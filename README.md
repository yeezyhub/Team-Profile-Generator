## Description

  Since everything is getting automated in today's world to deal with bigger data, why would creating a team be manual? The motivation behind this project is to help users to create team cards with ease and assign specific information to each of them just using keyboard using the embedded terminal of VSCode with Node.JS. This project is especially helpful for the bigger teams in terms of typing all the information one by one. With this application I solve this problem learning and utilizing the Inquirer and the Jest for prompting and testing.
